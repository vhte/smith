# Smith

This is a experiment to represent in code-level how Smith was capable to destroy the Matrix by being "unplugged".

The experiment consists in a single system agent (Smith) corrupting all other individuals nearby by replicating its code. The execution ends when all individuals are copies of the first agent and they can't collaborate with each other since their main action was overwritten.

To run the experiment just call `python main.py`. There's a time interval inside this file that can be adjusted for visual purposes.
